## Description 

Studies have shown that wearing a face mask can reduce the spreading of ongoing COVID-19 viruses by **65 percent** [1]. However, there still are many people who forget - or choose not - to wear a face mask in a public area. The main purpose of COVIDoor’s COVID screening automatic door is to ‘screen’ the potential spreading of this highly contagious virus in populated buildings by only granting access to those with a face mask on and has a normal temperature. The system will utilize an infrared sensor that measures the user’s temperature, as well as a camera that is pre-trained to detect a mask. The CPU will be programmed to take in the data from the infrared sensor and the camera and make a decision whether to open the door or not. Finally, the system will have an automatic door module that is controlled automatically by the CPU, which will allow access to those who pass the screening process.
