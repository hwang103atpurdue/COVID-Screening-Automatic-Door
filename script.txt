Major milestones and timeline for our project. 

- First milestone that we're trying to be on is deciding on which hardware to build our system on as well as the equipments. 
- We need a CPU that is python compatable, which will be used to control our entire system. - Raspberri pi is our strongest candidate up till now, because arduino won't be strong enough to power deep learning and image processing. If in case we need more power, we are considering a switch to Jetson NANO developer's board. 
- We will also need a camera sensor for image recognition. 
- Then, a thermal sensor for temperature checking system, relays and servo motors for automatic door  are required for our project. We'll decide on these hardwares by week 2. 

Completing the software for mask detector. 

- We'll use an open source python conputer vision library called OPEN CV to analyze the image from camera to detect people with masks on. The mask detector will have a pre-made cascade from deep learning. It will be trained with set of images of people with masks on and those who do not. 
- Our goal for week 4 is to have the core software (deep learning capable mask detector) built and running, 

- So this leads to our next milestone, which is adding the temperature detector to the core software


Our final product will look something like this. The image on the right is just a prototype design that one of our members Hayley has drawn, which basically shows the GIST of what our device will be equipped with. 

- The device will have a camera... 
- Whenever someone tries to open the door, he/she will ne

Solution Proposal: 

Slide 8: 

Shown above is the system level block diagram for our project. We have differentiated hardware and software modules by using square and diamond shape respectively. 

- The two input to the system is made from the camera and the infrared sensor. Images from the camera will be fed into the mask detector where the neural network is already modeled from training images. The mask detector module will process the image to scan for a mask, and sends the necessafy data to the master controller. 

- On the other side, infrared sensor will send in the temperature data to the temperature checker module, where it process the data to isolate the user's temperature from surrounding temperatures. The data will then be sent to the master controller, and the master controller will determine which message to display on the screen as well as whether or not to send a command to the door controller triggering the automatic door. 


Slide 9: 

Shown on this slide is a more in depth activity diagram of our system. 
1. System starts when a user is detected. Temp checker, Mask detector will start operating Simultaeniouly. 
2. What's worth noting in this slide is how our CPU or our master controller operates. 
- As we've presented in previous slides, there are two inputs to the master controller. 
- CPU will check the data from the
